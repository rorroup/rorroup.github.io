									I am an electrical engineer and I program as a hobby. As such, I sometimes come up with a bunch of ideas I want to try so I build small programs where I can apply and test concepts to experiment how the parts involved interact with each other. I have encountered slow programs and bugs so building something with a specific behaviour myself allows me to asess whether the different components are working properly.<br/>
									
									Therefore I built this website to hold those experiments. Besides it being hosted on the web gives me more flexibility and allows me to share it with other people should the need ever arise. I had no actual content for it though so I populated it with how the page itself was made instead in part to document what I learned. Maybe someone could find that information useful. That said, I've had my fair share of internet myself so I decided to make the page itself in kind of a meme fashion inspired by the things I like. The technical side should still be trustworthy though, it works after all. Trust me, I'm an engineer.<br/>
